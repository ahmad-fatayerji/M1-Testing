This can be obtained with an instance of the class `BasicPlannerImpl`.

```java
BasicPlanner planner = new BasicPlannerImpl();
```

=== Create and add meetings

```java
// Prepare the time zone
ZoneId timeZone = ZoneId.systemDefault();

// Prepare start and end of the meeting
Instant teamMeetingStart = TimeManagement.createInstant("2024-07-10 19:00", timeZone);
Instant teamMeetingEnd = TimeManagement.createInstant("2024-07-10 23:00", timeZone);

// Create the meeting
Meeting teamMeeting = new MeetingImpl(teamMeetingStart, teamMeetingEnd,"Team meeting");

// Add the meeting to the planner
planner.addMeeting(teamMeeting);
```

=== Move a meeting

```java
// Move the meeting to the next day
Instant teamMeetingNewStart = TimeManagement.createInstant("2024-08-10 09:30", timeZone);
planner.moveMeeting(teamMeeting,teamMeetingNewStart);
```

=== Set a reminder

```java
// Set a reminder to be triggered 30 minutes before the meeting
teamMeeting.setReminder(Duration.ofMinutes(30));
```

=== See current meeting

```java
Meeting currentMeeting = planner.seeCurrentMeeting();

```

=== See current reminders

List<Meeting> activeMeetings = planner.seeActiveReminders();
